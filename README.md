# Boto3ForBeginnersByABeginner
I amsSharing what I've learned at the most basic level to others who need or want the stepping stones to better automation. I recently received my AWS Solutions Architect Associate certification and have been learning the AWS Command Line, bash scripting and python.
Here you'll find python scripts for various AWS services that are very basic but allow newbies to see how the code works and what is avaialble.
I didn't always find what examples of what I was looking for and many answers were beyond my skill set. So I write the code and comment it so I know what/why things happen when little changes in code can mean a lot.

I use a Windows 10 PC, so much of the scripting is based there. Some of the code is based on Linux bash too (or will be once I upload it).

Again - this is for beginners by a beginner so it's basic but hopefully educational. This is my perspective and I'm sure there's a better way or a different way to code, and that's your perogaritive, but this is what I know  - that's my disclaimer.

Feel free to use anything you find or let me know if there's something I can add that will help other's who want to start using AWS and boto3, but don't know where to start.

The first document I'll add soon is the software you'll need to load on your Windows machine to get it ready for coding.

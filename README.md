# Boto3 For Beginners By A Beginner

I am sharing what I've learned at the most basic level to others who need or want the stepping stones to better AWS automation.

Feel free to use anything you find or let me know if there's something I can add that will help others who want to start using AWS and boto3 but don't know where to start.

 - the .py script runs and prints out several basic commands for dealing with s3 Buckets

*    looping through json and policy statements

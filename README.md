# Boto3 For Beginners By A Beginner

I am sharing what I've learned at the most basic level to others who need or want the stepping stones to better AWS automation. 

I haven't always found examples of what I was looking for and many answers were beyond my skill set. So I've compiled some scripts and associated notes (text files) so I could find out what/why things happen when little changes in code can mean a lot.

I use a Windows 10 PC, so much of the scripting is based there. Some of the code is based on Linux bash too (or will be once I upload it).

Again - this is for beginners by a beginner so it's basic but hopefully educational. This is my perspective and I'm sure there's a better way or a different way to code, and that's your perogaritive, but this is what I know  - that's my disclaimer.

Feel free to use anything you find or let me know if there's something I can add that will help others who want to start using AWS and boto3 but don't know where to start.

The first document I'll add soon is the software you'll need to load on your Windows machine to get it ready for coding.
